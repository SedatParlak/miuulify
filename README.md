Miuulfiy is a music recommendation site where users can share Spotify songs. The site analyzes the shared songs and recommends similar music genres and moods to users. It uses the Spotify API and two different ML models to do so. These models predict the genre and mood of the song shared by the user. Based on these predictions, similar tracks are presented to the user through the recommendation system.
